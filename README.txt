Now Mode — Downloadable Bundle
=================================

Files:
- index.html  — the UI (no glow, customizable)
- app.js      — logic (localStorage, CRUD, chart, undo/export)

How to use:
1) Put both files in the same folder.
2) Open index.html in your browser (Safari/Chrome).
3) Add to Home Screen on iOS for PWA-like behavior.
4) Click ⚙︎ Manage to add/edit/delete habits & vices.
5) Use ▲/▼ and Apply to log actions; sliders auto-save for today.
6) Export to download a text file with CSVs (actions + metrics).

Storage:
- nowmode.logs    — action records
- nowmode.metrics — per-day sliders (sleep/mood/energy/focus)
- nowmode.catalog — your custom items

Note: Chart.js is loaded via CDN; viewing offline requires prior cache or internet.
